### Examples Files vs Your Project

Note that example files are meant to provide you will a template, basic source code, and examples for how to complete an assignment.
However, you must modify them substantially to make them into your own project.

**README files** - Each folder has a README.md file with tutorial-like instructions
**Examples** - Files in the example folder can be copied to your project folder and opened in your code editor to modify
