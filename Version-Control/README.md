# Introduction to Version Control
## Git and GitHub


Welcome to this tutorial on version control. This guide will walk you through the fundamentals of Git.

---

### 1  What is Version Control

**Version Control** (also known as Source Control or Revision Control) is a system that tracks changes to files over time, allowing you to recall specific versions later. Think of it as a "time machine" for your code.

#### Why Do We Need Version Control?

- **Backup & Recovery**: Never lose your work again
- **Collaboration**: Multiple people can work on the same project
- **History Tracking**: See who changed what and when
- **Branching**: Work on features without affecting the main code
- **Rollback**: Easily revert to previous versions if something breaks
- **Code Review**: Track changes and review code before merging

### 2  Git Glossary of Terms

#### Core Concepts

- **Repository (Repo)**: A directory containing your project and its version history
- **Commit**: A snapshot of your code at a specific point in time
- **Branch**: A separate line of development
- **Merge**: Combining changes from different branches
- **Clone**: Creating a local copy of a remote repository
- **Push**: Uploading local changes to a remote repository
- **Pull**: Downloading changes from a remote repository

#### Important Terms

- **Working Directory**: Where you edit files
- **Staging Area**: Where you prepare files for commit
- **HEAD**: Pointer to the current commit
- **Master/Main**: Default branch name
- **Origin**: Default name for the remote repository
- **Fork**: A copy of someone else's repository
- **Pull Request**: Request to merge changes into another repository

### 3  Your First Repo - Commit and Push "Hello World" file using Github Desktop

While Git can be used entirely from the command line, we'll use **GitHub Desktop** to simplify the learning process. GitHub Desktop provides a user-friendly graphical interface that makes the most common Git operations accessible without memorizing commands.

#### Why GitHub Desktop?

- **Beginner-Friendly**: Visual interface is easier to understand than command line
- **Common Operations**: Covers 90% of what you'll do with Git
- **Error Prevention**: Helps avoid common mistakes
- **Visual Feedback**: See changes, history, and branches clearly
- **Cross-Platform**: Works on Windows, Mac, and Linux
- **Free**: No cost to use

### 4  Resolving Merge Conflicts

When multiple people work on the same file or when you work on different branches, Git may encounter **merge conflicts**. This happens when Git can't automatically merge changes because they conflict with each other.

#### What Causes Merge Conflicts?

- **Same Line Changes**: Two people modify the same line in different ways
- **File Deletion**: One person deletes a file while another modifies it
- **Divergent Branches**: Branches have diverged and contain different commits
- **Conflicting Pull Requests**: Multiple PRs modify the same code

#### Example Scenario: Text File Conflict

Let's say you and a colleague are working on the same `hello-world.txt` file:

**Your version:**
```
Hello, World!
Welcome to our project.
This is my contribution.
```

**Colleague's version:**
```
Hello, World!
Welcome to our project.
This is their contribution.
```

When you try to merge, Git will show a conflict because both of you modified the same line.

#### Resolving Conflicts with GitHub Desktop

##### Step 1: Identify the Conflict

1. **Pull latest changes**: In GitHub Desktop, click "Fetch origin" then "Pull origin"
2. **Conflict detected**: GitHub Desktop will show "Merge conflicts detected"
3. **Click**: "Open in editor" or "Resolve conflicts"

##### Step 2: Understand the Conflict Markers

Git adds special markers to show conflicts:

```
<<<<<<< HEAD
This is my contribution.
=======
This is their contribution.
>>>>>>> branch-name
```

- `<<<<<<< HEAD`: Start of your changes
- `=======`: Separator between conflicting changes
- `>>>>>>> branch-name`: End of incoming changes

##### Step 3: Resolve the Conflict

**Option A: Keep Your Changes**
```
Hello, World!
Welcome to our project.
This is my contribution.
```

**Option B: Keep Their Changes**
```
Hello, World!
Welcome to our project.
This is their contribution.
```

**Option C: Combine Both Changes**
```
Hello, World!
Welcome to our project.
This is my contribution.
This is their contribution.
```

**Option D: Write Something New**
```
Hello, World!
Welcome to our project.
This is our combined contribution.
```

##### Step 4: Complete the Resolution

1. **Remove conflict markers**: Delete all `<<<<<<<`, `=======`, and `>>>>>>>` lines
2. **Save the file**: In your text editor
3. **Return to GitHub Desktop**: The conflict should be resolved
4. **Stage the file**: Click the checkbox next to the resolved file
5. **Commit the merge**: Add a message like "Resolve merge conflict in hello-world.txt"

#### Advanced Conflict Resolution Examples

##### Example 1: Code File Conflict

**Original file:**
```javascript
function greet(name) {
    return "Hello, " + name;
}
```

**Your changes:**
```javascript
function greet(name) {
    return "Hello, " + name + "!";
}
```

**Their changes:**
```javascript
function greet(name) {
    return "Hi, " + name;
}
```

**Resolution (combining both):**
```javascript
function greet(name) {
    return "Hello, " + name + "!";
}
```

##### Example 2: File Structure Conflict

**Scenario**: You added a new file `config.json` while someone else deleted it.

**Resolution options:**
- **Keep the file**: If the configuration is still needed
- **Delete the file**: If it's no longer required
- **Rename the file**: If there's a naming conflict

##### Example 3: Complex Code Conflict

**Original:**
```python
def calculate_total(items):
    total = 0
    for item in items:
        total += item.price
    return total
```

**Your changes:**
```python
def calculate_total(items):
    total = 0
    for item in items:
        total += item.price
        if item.discount:
            total -= item.discount
    return total
```

**Their changes:**
```python
def calculate_total(items):
    total = 0
    for item in items:
        total += item.price
    return total * 1.1  # Add 10% tax
```

**Resolution (combining features):**
```python
def calculate_total(items):
    total = 0
    for item in items:
        total += item.price
        if item.discount:
            total -= item.discount
    return total * 1.1  # Add 10% tax
```

#### Best Practices for Conflict Resolution

1. **Communicate**: Talk to your team before resolving conflicts
2. **Understand the changes**: Read both versions carefully
3. **Test your resolution**: Make sure the code still works
4. **Use meaningful commit messages**: Explain what you resolved
5. **Consider code review**: Have someone review complex resolutions
6. **Backup first**: Create a backup branch before resolving

#### Preventing Conflicts

1. **Pull frequently**: Keep your local branch up to date
2. **Work on different files**: Coordinate with team members
3. **Use feature branches**: Work on separate branches for features
4. **Communicate changes**: Let team know what you're working on
5. **Small, frequent commits**: Make smaller, more frequent commits

#### When to Ask for Help

- **Complex conflicts**: When you're unsure about the resolution
- **Business logic conflicts**: When changes affect core functionality
- **Multiple file conflicts**: When many files have conflicts
- **Unfamiliar code**: When you don't understand the conflicting code
